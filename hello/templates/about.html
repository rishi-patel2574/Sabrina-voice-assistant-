    <section class="mt-4">
        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>"Sabrina" is a voice assistant project designed for my 5th-semester project at NV Pass College. Named after the famous singer Sabrina Carpenter, this project is aimed at helping users interact with their system and external services using voice commands. It simplifies daily tasks such as opening applications, searching the web, and retrieving information from platforms like Wikipedia and YouTube, making user interactions more intuitive and hands-free.</p>

    <section class="mt-4">
        <h2>Key Functionalities</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Voice-activated commands for web searches, opening YouTube, Google, StackOverflow, and playing music.</li>
            <li>Time queries (e.g., asking for the current time).</li>
            <li>Opening applications such as VS Code and other system-based commands.</li>
            <li>User authentication system (login/signup).</li>
            <li>Real-time interaction with voice commands and responses.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="mt-4">
        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        <p>While "Sabrina" offers a wide range of functionalities, there are a few limitations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Limited understanding of complex or ambiguous voice commands.</li>
            <li>Currently restricted to predefined web services and applications.</li>
            <li>Dependency on a stable internet connection for external services (e.g., Wikipedia, YouTube).</li>
            <li>Basic error handling for unrecognized commands.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
